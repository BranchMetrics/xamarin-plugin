# Tune Xamarin Plugins

Please see the Quick Start guide here:

[Xamarin Quick Start](https://developers.tune.com/sdk/xamarin-quick-start/#code-platform-xamarin)

## Developers

These plugins were developed in Xamarin Studio https://www.xamarin.com/download

The iOS and Android plugins are available in separate solutions. To edit them, open the ios/Tune.Xamarin.iOS.sln or android/Tune.Xamarin.Android.sln with Xamarin Studio.

For both platforms the solution includes the plugin source (including a bundled version of the Tune iOS or Android SDK) and a sample app called "Test App"

## Sample Apps

Included with both the iOS and Android plugins is a Test App that references the plugin source directly.
